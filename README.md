**🏨 AtliQ Grands – Hospitality Revenue & Performance Analytics**

**📌 Executive Summary**

This project evaluates the revenue performance of AtliQ Grands across multiple cities, room categories, and booking platforms over a three-month period.

Despite maintaining steady booking volumes, revenue growth showed inconsistencies. This analysis investigates the root causes by examining pricing strategy, occupancy trends, realization rates, and channel performance.

The final deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to support decision-making for Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Leadership teams.

**
🗂 **Data Architecture & Modeling Approach****

The dataset was structured using a star schema model, integrating multiple CSV sources into:

Fact Tables: Booking & revenue transactions

Dimension Tables: Date, Property, Room Category, Booking Platform

Key implementation steps:

Data cleaning & transformation

Relationship building

Creation of DAX-based KPI measures

Interactive filtering (City, Room Class, Week, Day Type)

**📊 Core Performance Metrics**

The analysis framework focused on industry-standard hospitality KPIs:

Revenue

ADR (Average Daily Rate)

RevPAR

Occupancy %

Realisation %

DSRN / DBRN / DURN

Cancellation Rate

Average Customer Rating

**🔎 Strategic Insights**

1️⃣ Occupancy Drives Revenue Volatility

Occupancy ranged from ~44% to 66%, indicating demand concentration in specific properties. RevPAR fluctuations were primarily occupancy-driven rather than pricing-driven.

2️⃣ Stable Pricing Strategy

ADR remained relatively consistent (~₹12.7K), suggesting disciplined pricing. Revenue variability was demand-based rather than discount-led.

3️⃣ Luxury Segment Dominance

Luxury rooms contributed ~61.6% of total revenue, highlighting dependency on premium offerings.

4️⃣ Weekend Demand Surge

Weekend occupancy (62.6%) significantly exceeded weekday occupancy (55.8%), reflecting stronger leisure demand patterns.

5️⃣ Channel Performance Variation

While Realisation % remained consistent (~70%), ADR differed across booking platforms, affecting profitability mix.

💡 **Business Recommendations**

Optimize Property-Level Pricing
Adjust pricing dynamically based on occupancy bands instead of uniform rate strategy.

Strengthen Midweek Demand
Introduce corporate partnerships and work-from-hotel packages to stabilize weekday occupancy.

Channel Profitability Strategy
Encourage direct bookings for high-performing properties while leveraging OTAs for underperforming locations.

Diversify Revenue Mix
Expand business segment packages to reduce over-reliance on luxury revenue streams.
